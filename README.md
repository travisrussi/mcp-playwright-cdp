## CDP Connection

This fork adds the ability to connect to an existing Chrome instance via CDP. To use this feature:

1. Launch Chrome with remote debugging enabled:
```bash

```

2. The server will automatically attempt to connect to the running Chrome instance first, before launching a new browser.
